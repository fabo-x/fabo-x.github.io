# Xingzhi High School 2018

#### _**XINGZHI HIGH SCHOOL - FABLAB O - FABO X ACADEMY**_

### **THE FUTURE OF MANUFACTURING: MAKE YOUR OWN SMART LABORATORY TOOLS**

#### _3D MODELING & PRINTING_

In the past, 3D design was a subject that students would only begin to learn in college. Today, with software and the growth of 3D printing, the process of advancing from an idea in your head to a physical object in your hand can be achieved in a simple way by students of any age. 3D Design is a great entry point to a variety of STEAM fields and the skills students develop directly relate to math proficiencies including the ability to:

* Understand and manipulate fractions
* Name and classify shapes
* Explore transformations
* Work with and convert units of measurement
* Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, transparencies, or geometry

​

When 3D design skills on software are paired with 3D printing training, the students learn how to test hypothesis, evaluate solutions and make necessary corrections experiencing how rapid prototyping allows to simultaneously work on design and manufacturing.

### **Learning Outcomes**

* Put into practice math and geometry notions.
* Develop and apply design skills.
* Identify errors, find and test solutions.
* Understand why and how an automatic machine works.
* Follow instructions and fabricate a final project working as a team.

​

### **Agenda**

The focus of the course will be on developing the basic skills of 3D modeling software and 3D printing, moving from design to manufacturing in a dynamic way. At the same time, the course will introduce some smaller subjects like mechanics, electronic controller and computer code. This will be helpful to develop a broader understanding of the technological aspects related to automatic machines, the way we can control them and the products we can make with. They will have to design and prototype a tool that can be used in the Fablab including a smart NFC token in it, so the tool can give information to the user’s phone when using it.

​

### **Tools, Software, Materials & Budget**

* Computers
* 3-D printers
* TinkerCAD
* Cura
* 3-D printer filament
* Adhesives
* Hand-held tools

### **Schedule**

**Week 1 Introduction. 3D printer tuning and test.**

After an introduction to history of manufacturing and CAD/CAM, students make the first tune of the 3D printers they will use during the course. They will level the bed, load the filament and start a test print.

**Week 2 Make the first print.**

The first print will be a basic object and the students will learn how to slice a model with Cura and to operate the machine with all the material already provided, to familiarize with the process. The models provided will be especially designed to demonstrate the peculiarity of the 3D printing process: bridges, overhangs, layer heights, moving parts. Each student will have to describe his/her test model to the class.

**Week 3-4-5 3D design software - Design and print a new tool.**

The lab is new, and it needs tools! The students will have to mesure already existing tools \(or their components\) and design and print new tools, with an eye to the structural behavior, strengh and resistance.

**Week 6 Project Introduction: design the intelligent tools of the future.**

The students will form five groups and they will start to apply design thinking to imagine and create the tools of the future. They will start with a documentation, brainstorming and design session. NFC technology will be introduced, with pre-made components.

**Week 7-8-9 Final Project: design and print your prototype.**

The groups will go over the rapid prototyping workflow already experienced in the individual work. It will be possible to work on extended hours.

**Final presentation.**

On one final occasion, there will be a presentation of the groups’ projects and a demonstration of the working tools. Each group will have to prepare a presentation with one informative image or a ppt presentation or a documentation webpage \(github\).

### **FINAL WORKS FROM THE STUDENTS**

### **SUPER M&I**

_A project by Bobo & ZKL_

_from Xingzhi High School._

​

Used to drive hex nuts

Put your finger in, fix screws,

then rotate!

...YEAHHHH!!!

AWESOME!!!

​

### **SCISSORX**

_A project by Wu Jing & Li Yi Wen_

_from Xingzhi High School._

​

This is an interesting 'scissor'

with the function of

a scissor and a wrench.

When you use it,

it is as simple as a scissor.

Just enjoy it!

​

### **A SPECIAL TOOL GUN**

_by the most handsome men_

_of Xingzhi High School!_

_Do you want to know them? Yes!_

_CXY, from class 1 grade 1_

_WRK, from class 2 grade 1_

​

Use this tool to drive hex nuts.

It can also make you cool,

if you hold it, you will

feel very comfortable:

you can pretend to

be a policeman...

come and use it!!!

### **CALIPANDLE**

_'a better caliper handle'_

_Designed by Jerry and Helen_

_from XINGZHI HIGH SCHOOL_

​

It is a handle which can

protect your hands from

the sharp caliper.

It can also show who

is using the caliper now.

​

### **CROSSRULER**

_designed by Mike and Nike_

_from Xingzhi High School_

​

You can put two rulers in it

to measure the length and

the width

at the same time.

Use it and if you have

some questions, come to

our school and ask us.

Or you can call us,

the phone number is:

134 7287 9796

We hope that you will like it!

### **TOOL INFORMATION BOX**

It is a system combining a NFC Tag Reader, a LCD screen and a Thermal Printer, running on Arduino Mega. Each tool from the students has a tiny \(15mm diameter\) NFC tag integrated in it and when the tool is placed over the "NFC" sign on the box, the ID Number of the tag is detected and a small receipt gets printed with basic informations about the tool and a QR code to get more informations.
